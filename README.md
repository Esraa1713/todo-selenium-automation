## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Automation Script

1. Install Selenium

pip install selenium

2. Install ChromeDriver

Download the version that matches your browser from:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Extract the downloaded file and place the chromedriver.exe in a known directory (e.g., C:/webdrivers/)

3. Set Up Your Script:

Ensure that your script includes the correct path to your chromedriver. 

Here's an example setup from todo_test.py

from selenium import webdriver  

from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service  

from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options  

chrome_options = Options()  

chrome_options.add_argument("--start-maximized")  

Update path for your system:

service = Service("C:/path/to/chromedriver.exe")  

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service, options=chrome_options)

4. Update Element Selectors (if needed)

If the HTML structure of the Todo app changes, you may need to update class selectors (names, tags, or XPaths) in the script.

5. Run the Script
To execute your automation:

python todo_test.py
